<!--What Are Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements?

Imagine you are organizing a notebook for school. You have different sections for each subject:

üìñ Math
üìñ Science
üìñ English

Now, think about how you label those sections:

Semantic Elements ‚Üí These are like clear labels üìå
If you write "Math Notes" on a page, anyone who sees it knows it's about Math.
In coding, if you use <header>, <section>, or <article>, the browser and search engines know what‚Äôs inside those sections.
Non-Semantic Elements ‚Üí These are like unlabeled folders üìÅ
If you just use a blank folder, people don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs inside until they open it.
In coding, <div> and <span> are just empty boxes‚Äîyou can put anything inside, but they don‚Äôt tell what the content is about. -->
   <!--Scenario 2: Non-Semantic Elements (Blank Boxes)

Now, what if we don‚Äôt use clear labels?
What‚Äôs Wrong Here?
All the content is inside <div>, but nothing tells us what each part is for.
The browser doesn‚Äôt know if it's a title, a section, or an article.
Search engines (like Google) won‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs important.
‚û° It‚Äôs like giving someone a notebook without subject labels‚Äîthey won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs inside until they read everything!

<!--Example in Real Life üìö
Scenario 1: Semantic Elements (Labeled Sections)

Imagine you are making a school project webpage about your favorite animal ü¶Å. -->

<!--What‚Äôs Happening Here?
<header> (Like a title page üìå) ‚Üí This tells us what the page is about.
<section> (Like a chapter üìå) ‚Üí Groups related content together.
<article> (Like a full story üìå) ‚Üí Stands alone, like a book page.
<footer> (Like a credits page üìå) ‚Üí Contains the author or extra info.
‚û° Anyone reading this code knows what‚Äôs in each section‚Äîjust by looking at it!-->

    <!-- Imagine This:
üë¶ A webpage with semantic elements is like a well-organized school notebook‚Äîanyone can read it easily.

üë¶ A webpage without them is like a messy notebook with no labels‚Äîpeople will struggle to find what they need.

Now, does that make sense? üòä Would you like another example? üöÄ-->
